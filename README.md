# AFLTips

### Description
A web app for my partner and I to enter our AFL (footy) tips in. 
* The tips will be compared with the game results automatically via an API.
* Points to be allocated accordingly to each player.
* A score for the season will be kept.
* Written using the Blazor Framework.

### Motive
More exposure to front-end development.
First experience with Blazor, become proficient.
